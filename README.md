# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
For this project, we created a workbook for Steve. At the click of a button, he has the ability to analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

### Results
Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary
<b>-What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?</b>

There are multiple advantages of refactoring code. Refactoring code means the making it more efficient, as such refactoring code means taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

<b>-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?</b>
